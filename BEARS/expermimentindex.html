    <span>This seems be what a span is just a
        heading for a title
    </span>

    <span>
        <h1><p>This has been made with a paragraph tag 
            inside a span tag and a h1 tag ,This is where i am going to put all my
            experiments to show what each tag does to 
            a webpage,also i would say there would be
            a lot of typing involved in making webpages

        </h1>
    </span>


    <span><h1><p>ow i am making more tags below to get
        use to using span tags, h1 tags
         and paragraph
         tags</p></h1>
    </span>

    <h1>h1 Makes the heading or makes the paragraph
        bold and easier to read as you see from the 
        two paragrpahs above.
    </h1>
